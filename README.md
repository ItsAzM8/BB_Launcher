Just a lightweight launcher for Bloodborne on shadPS4 (if I can get around to working on it)

Installation:
  Just place the exe next the shadPS4 exe. If you are using an SDL (no GUI) build for shadPS4, the other files in the BB Launcher folder have to be also transferred to the shadPS4 folder.

Current features:
  - Fixes the sound glitch when you crash at 60 fps
  - Creates backup saves after a configurable interval

Planned features:  
  - Trophy locking/unlocking
  - Mod manager (similar to the Generic Mod Manager on nexus, but automatically structures folders)
  - Change shadPS4 settings and patches from the launcher
