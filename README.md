Just a lighweight launcher for Bloodborne on shadPS4 (if I can get around to working on it)

Installation:

  Just place the exe next the shadPS4 exe. If you are using and SDL build for shadPS4, the other files in the folder have to be transferred as well (those are QT dependencies).

Current feature:

  Just the sound fix when you crash at 60 fps

Planned features:

  Backup saving
  
  Trophy locking/unlocking
  
  Mod manager (similar to the Generic Mod Manager on nexus, but automatically structures folders)
  
  Change shadPS4 settings and patches from the launcher
